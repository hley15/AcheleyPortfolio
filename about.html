     After my senior year, I moved to Pennsylvania, now I am in college majoring<br>
      in Computer Software Engineering Technology. When I was kid, I always want to<br>
       be a pilote, growing up, I realize computer science was a good fit for me and<br>
        I go for it. Let me share this with whoever is going to read this: <br>
"With hard work, with sacrifices...If you dedicate yourself, wake up every day <br>
and try and get better in anything you do, anything you love and believe in your dreams,<br>
